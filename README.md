## Configuring Online Images

To display online images (e.g., from a CDN) in your deployed project, configure allowed image hostnames in next.config.js.

For demo purposes, we‚Äôre using Unsplash images. You can use any image host, but be sure to add the hostname in your configuration.

Replace 'unsplash' with your own image `hostnames` if using a different service or add a new object.

## Theming and Styling

We use Tailwind CSS for styling. In tailwind.config.ts, you can customize theme settings such as fonts, colors, and animations.
